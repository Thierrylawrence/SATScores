  <h2> The context behind the project is that I wanted to see which states had a higher SAT score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between big states and higher scores because there are more people, or maybe smaller states and higher scores because less of them take the exams.</h2>

  <h2> 
    The feedback I received in my micro and macro prototypes were these:

  </h2>

  <li> 
    1. The photo had a shadow on it </li>
 <li>  2. The color scheme for the map is bad because red and blue generally indicate the political parties, democrat and republican, when they are on a map of the USA. Even if it doesn't, then that is what people would assume when they saw it.</li>  
   <li>3. Include Staten Island in the microprototype map</li>
   <li> 4. Outline every state properly. </li>
    
    I will modify all of these things in the final version.
