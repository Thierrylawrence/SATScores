  <h2> The context behind the project is that I wanted to see which states had a higher SAT score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between big states and higher scores because there are more people, or maybe smaller states and higher scores because less of them take the exams.</h2>

  <h2> 
    The feedback I received in my micro and macro prototypes were these:

  </h2>

  <h3> 
    1. The photo had a shadow on it
    2. The color scheme for the map is bad because red and blue generally indicate the political parties, democrat and republican, when they are on a map of the USA. Even if it doesn't, then that is what people would assume when they saw it.
    3. Include Staten Island in the microprototype map
    4. Outline every state properly. 
    
    I will modify all of these things in the final version.

  </h3>
